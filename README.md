# My Bookshelf Page

This project is a simple webpage that showcases my top 3 favorite books. It includes a header with the title and subtitle, a main section with a message and link to my Goodreads profile, a list of books and their information, and a footer with a copyright notice.

### Planning
To plan this project, I first brainstormed the content and layout of the page. I decided to showcase my top 3 favorite books, and to include book covers, titles, authors, and publication years for each book. I sketched out a rough design for the webpage, including the header, main section, and a footer. This helped me to see how different elements of the page would fit together and to make adjustments to the layout as needed.

### Building
To build the webpage, I started by creating a new HTML file and setting up the basic structure. Then, I added the header and main sections, including the book cover images and the book information in ordered lists.

After that, I created a separate CSS styles to customize the appearance of the page. Finally, I added JavaScript code to display the current date on the page. I used the Date object and ```toLocaleDateString``` method to get the current date in a readable format, and used the ```getElementById``` and ```textContent``` methods to set the date text in the HTML.


### Debugging
Throughout the building process, I regularly checked the webpage in a browser to make sure everything was displaying correctly. I also used the browser's developer tools to inspect the CSS and troubleshoot any issues I encountered. I tested the page on different devices and screen sizes to make sure it was responsive and looked good on all platforms.

During the building process, I encountered a few issues that required debugging. For example, I initially forgot to set the ```id``` attribute for the date element in the HTML, which caused an error when trying to access the element with JavaScript. I also had to adjust the CSS styles for the book list to make sure the images and text were aligned correctly.
